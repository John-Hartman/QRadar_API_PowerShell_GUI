This includes a PowerShell script to initiate a few API calls for different tasks within QRadar administration. This Script expects local directories be created, a QRadar IP be assigned, and an Auth Token be created for this script. 
The Log Sources function also assumes you have created a Module in your personal workbook for the QRadar_API_Metrics macro (Included).

This script is a bit messy and can definitely be done better. In the future this will essentially be recreated in Python.

The vba script is also somehting that was mostly recorded through the macro recorded in excel and could easily be shortened with some better vba savvy scripting.
